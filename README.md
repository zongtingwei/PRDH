### Acknowledgement:
The implementation is based on the code of [SM-MOEA](https://github.com/BIMK/SM-MOEA) and [PRDH](https://github.com/RuwangJiao/PRDH) and [PLATEMO](https://github.com/BIMK/PlatEMO). Thanks to them.
### Run:
You can use the main_prdh.m and the 'colon.mat' file in the 'dataset' folder to run this algorithm.
