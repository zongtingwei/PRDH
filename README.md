## 📖 Introduction

PRDH is a MATLAB-based evolutionary algorithm designed for solving multiobjective feature selection problems in classification tasks. It leverages problem reformulation and duplication handling to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of the feature selection process.

This implementation is based on the code of [PRDH](https://github.com/RuwangJiao/PRDH), [SM-MOEA](https://github.com/BIMK/SM-MOEA) and [PlatEMO](https://github.com/BIMK/PlatEMO). Please refer to the original paper [Solving Multiobjective Feature Selection Problems in Classification via Problem Reformulation and Duplication Handling](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9925116) for detailed information about the algorithm's overview, methodology, and benchmark results.

This code was developed for feature selection tasks in classification. The framework can be adapted to other feature selection scenarios with minor modifications.

### How to Run

1. Download the code and dataset from the repository.
2. Open MATLAB and set the working directory to the project root.
3. Run the `main_prdh.m` script.
4. You can choose the provided "colon.mat" file in the "dataset" folder for testing. (More datasets can be found in [Datasets](https://github.com/zongtingwei/Feature-Selection-FS-datasets))

```matlab
% an example
% you can find the code in `main_prdh.m` file
algorithmName = 'PRDH';  
dataNameArray = {'colon'}; % dataset
global maxFES
maxFES = 100;  % max number of iteration
global choice
choice = 0.6; % the threshold choose features
global sizep
sizep = 300; % size of population
```
